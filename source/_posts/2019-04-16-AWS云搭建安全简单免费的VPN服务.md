## Creating your Private VPN Server
================================

1\. Setup a free Amazon (AWS) cloud account.

2. Select a region for your VPN server.  
The VPN server can be in the following locations – North Virginia, Oregon, California, Ireland, Frankfurt, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, São Paulo. All your traffic will flow through the region that your VPN server is hosted. The selected region will appear in bold next to your name on the top header bar.

9\. Obtain the private VPN server IP address

Once the stack status shows as CREATE_COMPLETE you can then click on the Outputs tab.

![CloudFormation-OutputsTab ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CloudFormation-OutputsTab.png)

![CloudFormation-Outputs ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CloudFormation-Outputs.png)

Awesome, you should now have your private VPN server running in the IP address shown in the outputs tab. Please note that the IP address is unique for your server and you need it to connect your devices. **Now your VPN server is ready** and let us connect to it.

## Connecting to your private VPN server
=====================================

Each device has its own configuration to connect to a VPN server. We have added a how to for a few popular devices below. Please note that your private VPN server **supports both PPTP and L2TP** with IPSEC. This means that your VPN server supports most devices out there including older routers. You can connect to your VPN server with either PPTP or L2TP as supported by your device.

The parameters for your VPN connection are  
**Server Address**: The IP address from step 9 and this is unique for your VPN server.  
**VPN Username & Password**: From step 6 above. Same username & password for PPTP / L2TP VPN.  
**VPN Passphrase**: You set this up on step 6 above and only have to be used with an L2TP connection.

Examples below use PPTP but you can also find out how to setup L2TP with IPSEC on various websites.

![l2tp-1 ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/L2TP-1.png)

![l2tp-2 ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/L2TP-2.png)

![l2tp-3 ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/L2TP-3.png)

5\. For all other devices please search for Setting up PPTP VPN on my iphone and so on. You can also setup an L2TP IPSEC VPN which is more secure but might not be supported on all devices.

## Tips / Suggestions
==================

1\. If you want to delete your VPN server then just open CloudFormation on AWS. Make sure you select the same region that you created your VPN server. Then just click on Delete Stack button and your private VPN server will be removed.

![CloudFormation-DeleteStack ](https://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CloudFormation-DeleteStack.png)

2\. You can have multiple VPN servers all over the world. You just have to repeat the setup steps in this guide by selecting different regions. Please note that AWS free tier gives you a total of 750 hours a month free. You can also delete and create VPN servers as frequently as you want.

3\. Setting up a VPN connection on your router will allow all devices on its network to use the VPN server. This could be beneficial for use with AppleTV / Chromecast and any device that does not support a VPN.

4\. You can test if your VPN connection is active by just searching for “what is my ip address” on your favourite search engine. The IP address reported will be that of your private VPN server if everything is your connection is enabled. If your VPN connection is not enabled or if the VPN server settings are not complete then it will report your ISP’s IP address.
